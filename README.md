# comp-puzzles-practice

A place where I attempt to solve programming puzzles

### Contents:

- **eldarverse/** – problems from eldarverse
- **aoc/** – Advent of Code solutions by year/day
- each folder has the solution code and maybe some notes

### Notes:

- These are learning/practice solutions, not really optimized for speed
- I usually leave comments about how I figured the math out
- Some solutions are slow for big inputs but as long as they work I'm happy!
